LHCstairs is a social start-up started and run by a group of seven highly motivated and highly restless young college students. LHCstairs.com is a website (like Wikipedia) which aims to spread knowledge and clarity of thought around the world free of cost. It is aimed to serve the needs of restless and curious people across the globe who are looking to learn something new. This is a website which helps the person decide and judge what he/she wants to learn. It gives a crisp and an highly important overview of the field/topic he/she wants to learn.
